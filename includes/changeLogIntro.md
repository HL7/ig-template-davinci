This is a log of the significant changes that have happened to this specification since it was first released.  

For each release, changes are expressed with respect to the prior publication (snapshot, ballot, or official release) and are organized into the following categories:
* **Breaking changes**: Those that will cause instances from prior releases to no potentially no longer be conformant in the newer version of the specification
* **Substantive changes**: Changes that change the expectations on conformant systems.  I.e. systems will likely need to modify their code to continue complying with the guide.
* **Non-substantive changes**: These are changes that do not necessarily require the change of code, but may add clarification or optional features.

NOTES:
* This categorization is with respect to the standard, not any particular implementation.  Changes that are non-breaking from a standards perspective might still break existing implementations.  Non-substantive changes might still result in a need to add or change software code.
* This change list is not exhaustive.  Changes to formatting and layout, as well as corrections to spelling, grammar, hyperlinks, etc. are not called out here.
* Changes mentioned for older changes may no longer be relevant due to changes in subsequent versions.  To see an accurate reflection of changes, review the version of the guide the changes pertain to.
